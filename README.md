## 📝 Description

This repository presents a formal exploration of foundational set theory concepts, including subsets, supersets, proper and improper subsets. It includes concise proofs and logical statements demonstrating that every set is a subset, superset, and improper subset of itself. Ideal for students, educators, and enthusiasts seeking clarity on basic set relationships in mathematics.

## 🔹 Definitions

- **Subset (⊆):** Set A is a subset of B if every element of A is also in B.
- **Superset (⊇):** Set B is a superset of A if every element of A is also in B.
- **Proper Subset (⊂):** A ⊂ B if A ⊆ B and A ≠ B.
- **Improper Subset:** A subset that is equal to the set itself (i.e., A = B).

## 🔸 Theorems and Lemmas

### **(1) Every set is a subset of itself**

**Statement:**  
For any set A,  
  **A ⊆ A**

**Proof:**  
By definition, every element of A is in A.  
Hence, A is a subset of itself.

---

### **(2) Every set is a superset of itself**

**Statement:**  
For any set A,  
  **A ⊇ A**

**Proof:**  
Since A contains all its own elements, it is a superset of itself.

---

### **(3) Every improper subset is a subset of itself**

**Statement:**  
If A is an improper subset of B, and A = B, then  
  **A ⊆ A**

**Proof:**  
By definition, an improper subset is equal to the set itself.  
Hence, A ⊆ A.

---

### **(4) Every improper subset is also an improper subset of itself**

**Statement:**  
If A is an improper subset of B, and A = B, then  
  **A = A ⇒ A is an improper subset of itself**

**Proof:**  
Since A = A, and all elements match, A is an improper subset of itself.

---

### **(5) Every subset is an improper subset of itself**

**Statement:**  
If A ⊆ A, then A is an improper subset of A.

**Proof:**  
By definition, improper subset means A = A.  
Hence, A is an improper subset of itself.

## ✅ Conclusion

- Every set is both a subset and a superset of itself.
- Improper subsets are subsets that are equal to the original set.
- Every set is an improper subset of itself.
